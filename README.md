<h1 align="center">Hi there👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I´m Agustina, a passionate Full Stack Developer❤️</h3>
<p>💻I´m immersed in the fascinating world of programming. I started my journey as a self-taught enthusiast and recently graduated from Henry's bootcamp, which allowed me to become a Full Stack Developer.

My journey before programming was entirely different.😯<br><br>
🦷Three years ago, I graduated as a dentist, but I realized that I needed a change in my life.<br><br>
✈️I decided to embark on a journey and lived in Germany and Sweden for two years. This experience made me realize that I needed a profession that combined my passion for traveling with my adventurous personality.<br>
This made me take the decision to follow this path, and for the first time, I feel that I have found something that truly excites me, something that motivates me to keep learning continuously.💗
<br><br>
Throughout this time, I have gained strong knowledge in technologies like JavaScript, React JS, Redux, Node JS, PostgreSQL, and CSS. I am still thrilled to learn new technologies and strengthen the skills I already possess.
<br>
I´m always in search of opportunities to grow and take on new challenges. 
🤓Currently, I´m working on small development projects to gain more experience while continuing to enhance my skills in other technologies.
